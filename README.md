# flight404 Flocking Tutorial for Cinder 0.9.0

With the release of Cinder v0.9.0 the great tutorials ['Hello, Cinder'](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/tour/hello_cinder.html) and ['Flocking Tutorial'](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/flocking/chapter1.html) by [Robert Hodgin aka flight404](http://www.roberthodgin.com/) are officially out of date and its soure code is not bundled with the release zip. But the tutorial is still available under the [Cinder guides](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/index.html) and the reference source code can be retrieved from the [Cinder downloads](https://libcinder.org/download) with the release v0.8.6.

This repository is my implementation of the tutorial for Cinder 0.9.0. Since I was knew to Cinder this might not represent the best possible implementation. So please take my code as a starting point and with a grain of salt.

All code is written for [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) v0.9.0. Released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
